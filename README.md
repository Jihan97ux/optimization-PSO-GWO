## üìå Introduction  
This study compares the effectiveness of **Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO)** and **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** in solving the **Multiple Constraints Bounded Knapsack Problem (MCBK)**. The research is based on the inventory optimization problem at **Toko Citra Tani Jember**, inspired by Vidiyanti et al.  

The **objective** is to maximize **profit** while considering the following constraints:  
- **Maximum weight**: 5,000 kg  
- **Maximum volume**: 9,000,000 cm¬≥  
- **Maximum budget**: Rp 20,000,000  

**Findings:**  
- GWO achieved an optimal profit of **Rp 3,923,000** with a standard deviation of **0.13%**.  
- GWO showed more **stable results** with a **lower deviation (0.167%)** than PSO (4.3695%).  
- PSO was **faster**, but its solutions were **less stable and more variable**.

## üéØ Research Objectives  
1. **Compare** the optimization performance of GWO and PSO.  
2. **Analyze** the computational efficiency and stability of both algorithms.  
3. **Identify** the best approach for inventory management optimization.

## üõ† Methodology  
### **1. Problem Definition (MCBK Model)**  
The **Multiple Constraints Bounded Knapsack Problem (MCBK)** is formulated as:  

Maximize:  
z = ‚àë p·µ¢ x·µ¢  

Subject to:  
‚àë w·µ¢ x·µ¢ ‚â§ W  
‚àë v·µ¢ x·µ¢ ‚â§ V  
‚àë c·µ¢ x·µ¢ ‚â§ M  

where:  
- p·µ¢ = profit of item i  
- x·µ¢ = quantity of item i (decision variable)  
- w·µ¢ = weight per unit  
- v·µ¢ = volume per unit  
- c·µ¢ = cost per unit  
- W, V, M = maximum weight, volume, and budget  

### **2. Algorithm Implementations**  
#### **ü¶ä Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO)**  
- Inspired by **wolf pack hunting behavior**.  
- Uses **alpha, beta, delta wolves** to guide search space updates.
  
  D = | C * X_p(t) - X(t) |

  X(t+1) = X_p(t) - A * D
  
  A = 2a * r_1 - a
  
  C = 2a * r_2
  
- **Formula for position update:**
  
  D_alpha = | C1 * X_alpha - X |
  D_beta  = | C2 * X_beta  - X |
  D_delta = | C3 * X_delta - X |
  
  X1 = X_alpha - A1 * D_alpha
  X2 = X_beta  - A2 * D_beta
  X3 = X_delta - A3 * D_delta
  
  X(t+1) = (X1 + X2 + X3) / 3
  where (A, C) are control parameters.  

#### **üê¶ Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**  
- Inspired by **bird flocking behavior**.  
- Particles adjust their velocity and position based on:  
  v_i(t+1) = œâ * v_i(t) + c1 * r1_i * (p_i,best - x_i(t)) + c2 * r2_i * (g_best - x_i(t))

  x_i(t+1) = x_i(t) + v_i(t+1)

  where \( w \) is the inertia factor, \( c_1, c_2 \) are acceleration coefficients.  

### **3. Computational Setup**  
- **Processor:** Intel Core i5-6200U @ 2.30 GHz  
- **Programming Language:** Python (VS Code)  
- **Parameters:**  
  - **Population:** 25, 50, 100, 250, 500  
  - **Max Iterations:** 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 7,000

## üìä Results & Discussion  
### **Performance Comparison**  
| Algorithm | Best Profit | Avg. Profit | Std Dev (%) | Avg. Iterations | Avg. Computation Time (s) |
|-----------|------------|------------|------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| **GWO**   | Rp 3,923,000 | Rp 3,915,500 | **0.167%** | 553.8 | 134.49 |
| **PSO**   | Rp 3,908,000 | Rp 3,680,300 | **4.3695%** | 18.31 | 18.875 |

‚úÖ **GWO had higher stability** with the **lowest deviation (0.167%)**.  
‚úÖ **PSO converged faster**, but its solutions were **more variable**.  
‚úÖ **Best solution**: **GWO (Profit: Rp 3,923,000, Budget: Rp 19,998,000, Std Dev: 0.13%)**.  

### **Inventory Selection (Optimized Result)**  
| No | Item Name | Quantity | Unit |
|----|----------|----------|------|
| 1  | Altex Emulsion Paint 1 kg | 50 | Cans |
| 2  | Altex Emulton Paint 5 kg | 30 | Cans |
| 3  | Altex Cat Synthetic | 31 | Cans |
| 4  | Altex Plamir Kayu 1 kg | 45 | Cans |
| 5  | Paku 1" | 100 | kg |
| 6  | Bendrat | 51 | kg |
| 7  | Karbit | 50 | kg |

## üèÜ Conclusion  
- **GWO is more effective** for solving MCBK due to its **higher stability** and **better profit optimization**.  
- **PSO is faster**, but its solutions are **less consistent**.  
- **GWO achieved the best profit (Rp 3,923,000) with a stable standard deviation (0.13%)**.  
- Future research should **combine GWO and PSO** to balance **speed and stability**.
